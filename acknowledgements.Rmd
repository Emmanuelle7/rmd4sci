This books was first written to be a guide for a course run by the Statistics
Society Australia (SSA), and Melbourne Integrative Genomics (MIG) on November 12, 2018.

I'd like to first thank [Miles McBain](http://github.com/milesMcBain), for his working book, ["Git For Scientists"](https://milesmcbain.github.io/git_4_sci/index.html). This book inspired the structure and workflow of this existing book.
