# Rmarkdown for Scientists

This is a book that was initially developed as a 3 hour workshop on how to use RMarkdown. It covers the following topics:

- Creating your own R Markdown document
- Creating figures and tables that you can update with your data
- Changing the size and type of your figures
- Creating captions for your figures, and referencing them in text
- Exporting your R Markdown document to PDF, HTML, and Microsoft Word
- Using keyboard shortcuts to improve workflow
- Citing research articles and generating a bibliography
- Debugging and handle common errors

It is a work in progress, __a living book__, so to speak.
