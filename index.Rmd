# About this

This is a 3 hour workshop initially designed for the SSA Vic and MIG meeting on November 13, 2018.

After completing this course, you will know how to:

- Create your own R Markdown document
- Create figures and tables that you can reference in text, and update with - your data
- Export your R Markdown document to PDF, HTML, and Microsoft Word
- Use keyboard shortcuts to improve workflow
- Cite research articles and generate a bibliography

We may, depending on time, also cover the following areas:

- Change the size and type of your figures
- Create captions for your figures, and reference them in text
- Debug and handle common errors

## Why write this as a book?

There are many great books on rmarkdown and it's various features, such as ["Rmarkdown: The definitive guide"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/), ["bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), and ["Dynamic Documents with R and knitr. 2nd edition"](https://www.crcpress.com/Dynamic-Documents-with-R-and-knitr/Xie/p/book/9781498716963), and Yihui Xie's thesis, ["Dynamic Graphics and Reporting for Statistics"](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/13518/).

> So why write a book?

Good question. The answer is that writing this as a book provides a way for me to structure the content in the form of a workshop, in a way suitable for learning in a few hours.
